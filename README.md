# PHM Asia Pacific 2023
This project aims to face the [PHM Asia Pacific 2023 challenge](https://phmap.jp/program-data/).

### Requirements
The tools required to run our code with [Matlab](https://it.mathworks.com/products/matlab/student.html) are:
* [Diagnostic Feature Designer](https://it.mathworks.com/help/predmaint/ref/diagnosticfeaturedesigner-app.html) used to extract the signal and time features for the experiments;
* [Classification Learner App](https://it.mathworks.com/help/stats/classificationlearner-app.html) used to train classification models;
* [Regression Learner App](https://it.mathworks.com/help/stats/regression-learner-app.html) used to train regression models;
* [Deep Learning Toolbox](https://it.mathworks.com/products/deep-learning.html) used to calculate some accuracy metrics.

#### Running our program

To run our program and see the tests results, you just need to run the [tasks.m](https://github.com/FedericaParlapiano/Progetto-Manutenzione-PHM-Asia-2023/blob/main/testing/tasks.m) file inside the testing directory.\
The files contained in the main directory of the repository can be run to check the results obtained during training.
